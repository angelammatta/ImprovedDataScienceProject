# Improved Data Science Project
I redid my AP Computer Science A data science project so that it was more cohesive and cleaner. 
I divided up the data using SQL and I created the graphs using Python. 

For this project, I had to choose data that was meaningful to me so I chose data on the State Small Business Credit Initiative since small businesses are the backbone of our 
economy with the competition they provide. 

We had to do five calculations using the data, display them in graphs and explain what the data meant. 

The first time I did this project, I took quite a bruteforce approach for sorting the data instead of using loops and if-else statements. On top of that, I did not know much about the Python API known as pandas so it was quite hard to use it to sort the data. The program was quite messy and full of mistakes which altered the output significantly. 

This time I used SQL to divide up the data and perform the calculations. The program was a lot more organized and cohesive but I ended up with a lot of tables to display instead. I still used Python for the data visualization though.
